Chapter 3. Searching
======================
/string: To search for a string, use the /string command. To find the word include,
for example, use the command /include . An <Enter> is implied at the end of this 
command. (Any time the cursor jumps to the bottom of the screen and you type something,
you must be end it with <Enter>.)
  Note: The characters .*[]^%?~$ have special meaning. If you want to use them in a 
search you must put a \ in front of them. Example: to find . use search string \.
/string\c: ignore uppercase or lowercase

/<Enter> or n : To find the next include, use the command /<Enter>, Another way to find
the next match is with the n command. This command does the same thing as /<Enter>,but
does it with one less keystroke. 
Both the /<Enter> and n commands can have a count specified. If there is a count, the 
command searches for the count number of matches from the current location. 

?: The reverse search command (?) searches backward. The n command repeats the last
search. If a reverse search was the last one used, the n command searches in the 
reverse direction. If the last search was a forward search, the n command searches
forward.

N: The N command reverses the direction on the search and repeats it.

Search history: After you do a number of searches, you can use the <UP> and <DOWN> keys to select one of your recent searches.

Searching Options:
  hlserach or nohlsearch: Vim to highlight any strings found matching the search pattern 
use set hlsearch, and use :set nohlsearch cannel it.

  incsearch or noincsearch: incremental search in Vim is a powerful feature that allows 
you to search for text as you type, updating the search results in real time. This can 
be particularly useful when you're unsure of the exact text you're looking for or when
you need to find a specific pattern within a large document.
