Chapter 4
Text Blocks and Multiples Files
===============================
This chapter discusses the following topics:
	*Simple cut-and-paste operations (in Vim terms,delete and put)
	*Marking locations within the text
	*Copying text into a register using the yank commands
	*Filtering text
	*Editing multiple files

Cut, Paste, and Copy
--------------------
p	When you delete something with d, x, or another command,
	the text is saved. You can paste it back using the p
	command.

Character Twiddling
-------------------
Frequently when you are typing, your fingers get ahead of your
brain. The result a typo such as teh for the. The Vim editor
makes it easy to correct such problems.Just put the curosr on
the e of teh and execute the command xp.
	x  Delete the character 'e' and places it in a register
	p  Puts the text after the cursor, which is on the 'h'

More on "Putting"
----------------
You can execute the p command multiple times. Each time, it inserts
another copy of the text into the file.
The p command places the text after cursor. The P command places the 
text before the cursor. A count can be used with both commands and,
if specified, the text will be inserted count times.


Marks
-----
The Vim editor enables you to place marks in your text. The command ma
marks the place under the cursor as mark a. You can place 26 marks (a
through z) in your text.
  To go to a mark, use the command `mark, where mark is the mark letter
(and ` is the backtick or open single-quote character).
  The command'mark (single quotation mark, or apostrophe) moves you to the
beginning of the line containing the mark. This differs from the `mark commnd,
which moves you to the marked line and column.
  The 'mark command can be very useful when deleting a long series of lines.
To delete a long series of lines, follow these steps:
  1, Move the cursor to the beginning of the text you want to delete.
  2, Mark it using the command ma. (This marks it with mark a)
  3, Go to the end of the text to be removed, Delele to mark a using the 
     command d'a
