In Vim, the `ZZ` (capital Z) command is used to **save the current file and exit Vim**. 
It's a shortcut for performing both the `:w` (write/save) and `:q` (quit) commands in one step.

### What happens when you press `ZZ`:
- **Save the file**: It writes any changes made to the file (if there are changes).
- **Exit Vim**: After saving, Vim exits and returns to the shell or terminal.

### Usage:
- You don't need to be in insert mode or normal mode when using `ZZ`. 
  Simply press `Shift+Z` twice while in **normal mode**.
- If you haven't made any changes to the file, `ZZ` will exit Vim without saving (just like `:q`).
- If the file has been modified, `ZZ` will save it before quitting.

### Example:
1. You’re editing a file in Vim.
2. Press `ZZ` in normal mode.
3. The file is saved, and Vim exits.

### Comparison with other commands:
- `:wq` — This also saves the file and exits Vim but requires typing the full command.
- `:x` — This is similar to `ZZ`, saving the file and quitting, but it only saves if changes have been made.
  
In summary, `ZZ` is a quick and convenient way to save and exit Vim.
